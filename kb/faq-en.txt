​General Policy:​​ Admissions strictly adhere to the policies and regulations of the Ministry of Education of China and the relevant provincial (autonomous region, municipality) admissions committees. The process is managed by the University's Admissions Leadership Group, complying with the "Ten Strict Prohibitions," "30 Don'ts," and "Eight Basic Requirements" for college admissions work. We implement the "Ten Public Disclosures" for admissions information and voluntarily subject ourselves to public oversight. Policy-based bonus points for applicants follow the regulations of their respective home provinces. There are no specific subject score requirements, and foreign language programs do not require oral examinations.
​Subject Requirements:​​

​Reform Provinces:​​ For provinces implementing the college entrance examination reform ("Gaokao Reform"), the subject requirements for majors are as published by the provincial admissions authority in the student's home province. Applicants must meet the subject requirements for the programs they apply to.
​Non-Reform Provinces:​​ For provinces not implementing the reform, applicants must meet the Arts or Sciences stream requirements for the programs they apply to.


​Major Assignment for Admitted Students (by Province Type):​​

​Provinces using "University" or "University Program Group" Admission:​​ For admitted students, major assignment follows the "​Major Priority​" principle. Students are assigned majors based on the order of their listed preferences and their scores, from highest to lowest. If the first choice cannot be accommodated, the second choice is considered, then the third, and so on.
​Tie-Breaking Rules:​​ When applicants have identical admission scores, the tie-breaking rules are applied in the following order:

​​(1) "3+1+2" Reform Provinces:​​

History-First Track: Sum of Chinese & Math scores > Chinese score > Foreign Language score > History score > Highest score in a selective subject.
Physics-First Track: Sum of Chinese & Math scores > Math score > Foreign Language score > Physics score > Highest score in a selective subject.


​​(2) "3+3" Reform Provinces:​​ Sum of Chinese & Math scores > Foreign Language score > Highest score in a selective subject.
​​(3) Non-Reform Provinces:​​

Arts Stream: Sum of Chinese & Math scores > Chinese score > Foreign Language score.
Sciences Stream: Sum of Chinese & Math scores > Math score > Foreign Language score.

​Arts Program Admission:​​

Arts programs follow the admission rules of the student's home province and use the provincial standardized arts exam scores.
Applicants must meet both the provincial minimum cultural (Gaokao) score and the minimum professional arts exam score requirements.
Admission is based on the principle of "​Comprehensive Score Priority, Following Preferences​". Admitted students are assigned to programs based on their admission (comprehensive) score, from highest to lowest, according to their listed major preferences.
​Tie-Breaking:​​ For students with identical admission scores, the professional arts exam score is used (higher is better). If professional scores are also identical, the following are considered in order: Total Cultural Score (Chinese, Math, Foreign Language) > Chinese score > Math score > Foreign Language score.
​Henan Province Specific Calculation:​​ Admission Score = (Gaokao Cultural Score * 0.5) + (Provincial Arts Exam Score * 1.25).


​Major Adjustment:​​

If an admitted student cannot be placed into any of their preferred majors and indicates willingness to accept major adjustment, they will be randomly assigned to a major with available capacity.
If an admitted student cannot be placed into any of their preferred majors and does ​not​ accept adjustment, their admission will be rescinded (withdrawn).


​Health Requirements:​​ Health standards for all programs follow the relevant provisions of the "Guidelines for Physical Examination of Students Admitted to Regular Higher Education Institutions" issued by the Ministry of Education.
​Gender Ratio:​​ There are no gender ratio restrictions for any program.
